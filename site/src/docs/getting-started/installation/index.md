## System Requirements

Remark42 is designed to be lightweight and efficient. Based on production usage statistics from busy installations:

- **CPU**: Minimal usage (typically under 0.1%)
- **Memory**: ~80MiB RAM (less than 4% of 2GB)
- **Network**: Moderate bandwidth requirements
- **Disk**: Small footprint (under 200MB for a 5-year-old installation with regular activity)

These requirements make Remark42 suitable for running on small VPS instances, shared hosting environments, or even on Raspberry Pi and similar devices.

## Setup Remark42 Instance on Your Server

### Installation in Docker

_This is the recommended way to run Remark42_

- copy provided [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/umputun/remark42/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and customize for your needs
- make sure you **don't keep** `ADMIN_PASSWD=something...` for any non-development deployments
- pull prepared images from the Docker Hub and start - `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- alternatively, compile from the sources - `docker compose build && docker compose up -d`

### Installation with Binary

- download [archive for the stable release](https://github.com/umputun/remark42/releases)
- unpack with `gunzip` (Linux, macOS) or with `zip` (Windows)
- run as `remark42.{os}-{arch} server {parameters...}`, i.e., `remark42.linux-amd64 server --secret=12345 --url=http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- alternatively compile from the sources - `make OS=[linux|darwin|windows] ARCH=[amd64,386,arm64,arm]`

#### Installation as a systemd Service

For a clean persistent setup without lengthy command line parameters:

1. Create an environment file `/etc/remark42.env`:
   ```
   SECRET=12345
   REMARK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

1. Create a systemd service file `/etc/systemd/system/remark42.service`:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Remark42 Commenting Server
   After=syslog.target
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   EnvironmentFile=/etc/remark42.env
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/remark42 server
   WorkingDirectory=/var/www/remark42       # directory where data files are stored and automatic backups will be created
   Restart=on-failure
   User=nobody                              # another good alternative is `www-data`
   Group=nogroup                            # another good alternative is `www-data`

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

1. Enable and start the service:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable remark42.service
   sudo systemctl start remark42.service
   ```

1. To update configuration, edit the environment file and restart the service:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart remark42.service
   ```

## Setup on Your Website

Add config for Remark on a page of your site ([here](/docs/configuration/frontend/) is the full reference):

- `REMARK_URL` â€“ the URL where is Remark42 instance is served, passed as `REMARK_URL` to backend
- `YOUR_SITE_ID` - the `SITE` that you passed to Remark42 instance on start, `remark` by default.

```html
<script>
	var remark_config = {
		host: "REMARK_URL",
		site_id: "YOUR_SITE_ID",
	}
</script>
```

For example:

```html
<script>
	var remark_config = {
		host: "https://demo.remark42.com",
		site_id: "remark",
	}
</script>
```

After that place the code snippet right after config.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<script>!function(e,n){for(var o=0;o<e.length;o++){var r=n.createElement("script"),c=".js",d=n.head||n.body;"noModule"in r?(r.type="module",c=".mjs"):r.async=!0,r.defer=!0,r.src=remark_config.host+"/web/"+e[o]+c,d.appendChild(r)}}(remark_config.components||["embed"],document);</script>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

::: note ðŸ’¡
**Note:** You can place the config with the snippet in any place of the HTML code of your site. If it is closer to start of the HTML (for example in `<head>`) it will start loading sooner and show comments faster.
:::

Put the next code snippet on a page of your site where you want to have comments:

```html
<div id="remark42"></div>
```

After that widget will be rendered inside this node.

For more information about frontend configuration please [learn about other parameters here](https://remark42.com/docs/configuration/frontend/)
If you want to set this up on a Single Page App, see the [appropriate doc page](https://remark42.com/docs/configuration/frontend/spa/).

#### Quick installation test

To verify if Remark42 has been properly installed, check a demo page at `${REMARK_URL}/web` URL. Make sure to include `remark` site ID to the `${SITE}` list.

### Build from the source

- to build Docker container - `make docker`. This command will produce container `ghcr.io/umputun/remark42`
- to build a single binary for direct execution - `make OS=<linux|windows|darwin> ARCH=<amd64|386>`. This step will produce an executable `remark42` file with everything embedded
